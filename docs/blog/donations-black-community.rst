$1500 in donations matched by Write the Docs
============================================

About two weeks ago, we :doc:`announced a donation matching program </blog/we-stand-with-the-black-community>`
for non-profit organizations supporting the Black community and their ongoing efforts.

This week, we reached the goal of $1,500 in donations made by our community,
and Write the Docs made matching donations to nine different organisations.

We matched donations to the following organisations:

* NAACP Legal Defense Fund: $435

* Color of Change: $190
* Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI): $100
