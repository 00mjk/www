Community Sponsorship Options
=============================

We support our community in a variety of ways, and you can choose to focus 
your sponsorship on any one of them, at a level that suits you:

* Our conferences each have their own sponsorship prospectus
    - Our upcoming :doc:`Portland online conference </conf/portland/2020/sponsors/online-prospectus>`
* Our :doc:`/sponsorship/newsletter` with over {{ newsletter_subs }} subscribers
* Our :doc:`/sponsorship/website` offers both logo sponsorships and advertising 

In addition to these existing programs,
we're always interested in working together with organizations in our community to build new approaches to sponsorship. 
We believe we have one of the most skilled and forward-looking communities in tech,
and look forward to working together on keeping us sustainable.
