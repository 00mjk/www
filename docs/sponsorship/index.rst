Community Sponsorship Options
=============================

We offer a number of ways to sponsor Write the Docs events.
We have a number of services we provide our community,
and each of these is able to be sponsored at a different level:

* Our :doc:`/conf/index` each have their own sponsorship prospectus
    - Our upcoming :doc:`Portland online conference </conf/portland/2020/online-prospectus/>`
..  - Our upcoming :doc:`Prague online conference </conf/prague/2020/prospectus/>`
* Our :doc:`/sponsorship/newsletter` with over {{ newsletter_subs }} subscribers
* Our :doc:`/sponsorship/website` offers both logo sponsorships and advertising 

In addition to these existing programs,
we're always interested in working together with organizations in our community to build new approaches to sponsorship. 
We believe we have one of the most skilled and foreward looking communities in tech,
and look forward to working together on keeping us sustainable.
