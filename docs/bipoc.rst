Our #bipoc channel
==================

This is a space dedicated to supporting BIPOC (black, indigenous and people of color) members within our community.

Background
----------

As with many other professions, BIPOC remain painfully underrepresented in technical communication, software development, and open source.

<!-- SOME STATS WOULD BE USEFUL HERE. STATS FROM STC? -->

To shrink this racial disparity and to build equity, we offer this space as BIPOC tech writers to:

#. Emphasize the fact that we are already here, supporting one another and leading our communities.
#. Encourage the professional development of BIPOC in tech writing, software development, and related fields.

Purpose
-------

BIPOC need dedicated spaces for themselves in every profession, everywhere. We believe that one important way to practice anti-racism is to help other BIPOC communicators advance in their careers.

In a global field that is largely represented by `white`_ people, admonishing racism in spaces full of non-BIPOC people is limited in its impact. For one thing, these spaces do not capture the complexity of experiences that BIPOC have lived. BIPOC individuals and communities often experience various `intersections`_ of both privilege (e.g., `colorism`_) and discrimination (e.g., ability, gender identity, sexuality, citizenship status, neuro-status, linguistic `fluency`_).

How do we want to use this space?
---------------------------------

* Network and share opportunities for BIPOC people in technical communication, software development, and open source
* Share knowledge and resources about anti-racism
* Invite more BIPOC into our field
* Build community, visibility, and leadership opportunities specifically for BIPOC
* Coordinate and publicize joint events with organizations with similar goals (e.g., `Color Coded`_ in Los Angeles)

Allies
------

This is a public channel whose primary purpose is to support BIPOC writers. If you are not BIPOC, we thank you for acknowledging that this space is primarily meant for our personal and professional development.

We also invite you to participate as allies if you do not consider yourself BIPOC, and we invite you to abide by the same rules that guide any `decolonial`_ project: yield space that doesn’t belong to you.

<!-- MAYBE SOME ARTICLES ON HOW WHITE PEOPLE SHOULD RESPECT SPACES FOR BIPOC. -->

We acknowledge that we, as moderators, can speak confidently only about our own experiences, and that our efforts to communicate will, at times, fall short. Despite our shortcomings, we commit ourselves to supporting communicators who have been and continue to be marginalized because of their identities.
