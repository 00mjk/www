Our #bipoc channel
==================

This is a space dedicated to supporting BIPOC tech writers/software development/people in open source. 

Background
----------

As with many other professions, BIPOC are painfully underrepresented in both technical communication and software development.

<!-- SOME STATS WOULD BE USEFUL HERE. -->

To shrink this racial disparity, we offer this space as BIPOC tech writers to 1) emphasize that we are already here supporting each other and 2) to encourage the professional development of BIPOC in tech writing, software development, and related professions. We believe that one important way to practice anti-racism is to help other BIPOC communicators build equity by helping them advance in their careers. Admonishing racism in spaces full of non-BIPOC is limited in its ability to achieve these goals. 

Purpose
-------

BIPOC need dedicated spaces for themselves in every profession, everywhere, and BIPOC professionals remain painfully underrepresented in technical communication and software development.

Although we may personally abhor and fight racism as individuals, in a profession that is overrepresented by white people, admonishing racism in rooms full of non-BIPOC people does not build equity the way that supporting BIPOC careers does.

How do we want to use this space
--------------------------------

* Network and share opportunities for BIPOC people in technical communication and software development
* Share knowledge/resources about anti-racism in the world and in our profession
* Build community and visibility specifically for BIPOC
* Coordinate and publicize joint events with organizations with similar goals (e.g., Color Coded in Los Angeles)

Allies
------

This is a public channel primarily to support BIPOC writers. If you are not BIPOC, we thank you for acknowledging that this space is primarily meant for our personal and professional development.

<!-- MAYBE SOME ARTICLES ON HOW WHITE PEOPLE SHOULD RESPECT SPACES FOR BIPOC. -->
